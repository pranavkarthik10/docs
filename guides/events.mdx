Events are the core primitive in Flux. An event represents something that happened in your application—a user signed up, an order was placed, a payment succeeded.

## Event Structure

Every event has a consistent structure:

```json
{
  "id": "evt_1a2b3c4d",
  "type": "order.completed",
  "created": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "data": {
    "orderId": "ord_8x7kj2",
    "amount": 9900,
    "currency": "usd"
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Unique event identifier |
| `type` | string | Event type (e.g., `user.signup`) |
| `created` | string | ISO 8601 timestamp |
| `data` | object | Event payload |

## Sending Events

Use the SDK to send events:

```typescript
const event = await flux.events.send({
  type: 'user.signup',
  data: {
    userId: 'usr_123',
    email: 'jane@example.com',
    plan: 'pro',
    source: 'organic'
  }
});
```

### Idempotency

To prevent duplicate events, pass an idempotency key:

```typescript
await flux.events.send({
  type: 'payment.succeeded',
  data: { paymentId: 'pay_xyz' }
}, {
  idempotencyKey: 'pay_xyz_success'
});
```

If you send the same idempotency key twice within 24 hours, the second request returns the original event without creating a duplicate.

## Event Types

We recommend using dot notation to organize your event types:

| Pattern | Example | Use Case |
|---------|---------|----------|
| `resource.action` | `user.signup` | Standard events |
| `resource.action.status` | `payment.charge.failed` | Events with outcomes |

### Common Event Types

```
user.signup
user.login
user.updated
user.deleted

order.created
order.completed
order.cancelled

payment.succeeded
payment.failed
payment.refunded

subscription.created
subscription.renewed
subscription.cancelled
```

## Listing Events

Retrieve events from the API:

```typescript
const events = await flux.events.list({
  type: 'order.completed',
  limit: 50,
  startDate: '2024-01-01',
  endDate: '2024-01-31'
});

for (const event of events.data) {
  console.log(event.id, event.type, event.created);
}
```

## Event Retention

Events are stored for **90 days** on all plans. Enterprise customers can configure longer retention periods.
