Flux uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the [dashboard](https://app.flux.dev/settings/api-keys).

## API Key Types

| Type | Prefix | Use Case |
|------|--------|----------|
| Live | `sk_live_` | Production environment |
| Test | `sk_test_` | Development and testing |

Test keys only work with test data and don't trigger real webhooks or affect production resources.

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl https://api.flux.dev/v1/events \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_your_api_key"
```

Or use the SDK, which handles authentication automatically:

```typescript
const flux = new Flux('sk_live_your_api_key');
```

<Warning>
  Keep your API keys secure. Never commit them to version control or expose them in client-side code.
</Warning>

## Environment Variables

We recommend storing your API key in an environment variable:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Node.js">
    ```bash
    # .env
    FLUX_API_KEY=sk_live_your_api_key
    ```

    ```typescript
    import Flux from '@flux/node';
    const flux = new Flux(process.env.FLUX_API_KEY);
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```bash
    # .env
    FLUX_API_KEY=sk_live_your_api_key
    ```

    ```python
    import os
    from flux import Flux

    flux = Flux(os.environ["FLUX_API_KEY"])
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Key Rotation

To rotate an API key:

1. Create a new key in the [dashboard](https://app.flux.dev/settings/api-keys)
2. Update your application to use the new key
3. Delete the old key

<Tip>
  Create a new key before deleting the old one to avoid downtime.
</Tip>

## Scoped Keys

Enterprise plans support scoped API keys with limited permissions:

```typescript
const scopedKey = await flux.apiKeys.create({
  name: 'Analytics Service',
  scopes: ['events:read'],
  expiresAt: '2025-01-01T00:00:00Z'
});
```

Available scopes:

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `events:read` | List and retrieve events |
| `events:write` | Create events |
| `webhooks:read` | List webhooks |
| `webhooks:write` | Create and delete webhooks |

## Rate Limits

API requests are rate limited based on your plan:

| Plan | Requests per second |
|------|---------------------|
| Free | 10 |
| Pro | 100 |
| Enterprise | Custom |

When rate limited, you'll receive a `429` response with a `Retry-After` header.
