## Example

Here's how simple it is to send an event with Flux:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Node.js
import Flux from '@flux/node';

const flux = new Flux('sk_live_...');

await flux.events.send({
  type: 'user.signup',
  data: {
    userId: 'usr_123',
    email: 'jane@example.com',
    plan: 'pro'
  }
});
```

```python Python
from flux import Flux

flux = Flux("sk_live_...")

flux.events.send(
    type="user.signup",
    data={
        "user_id": "usr_123",
        "email": "jane@example.com",
        "plan": "pro"
    }
)
```

```go Go
import "github.com/flux-events/flux-go"

client := flux.New("sk_live_...")

client.Events.Send(&flux.Event{
    Type: "user.signup",
    Data: map[string]interface{}{
        "userId": "usr_123",
        "email":  "jane@example.com",
        "plan":   "pro",
    },
})
```
</CodeGroup>
