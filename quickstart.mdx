## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:

- A [Flux account](https://app.flux.dev/signup)
- Your API key from the [dashboard](https://app.flux.dev/settings/api-keys)
- Node.js 18+ (or Python 3.8+, Go 1.19+)

## 1. Install the SDK

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @flux/node
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @flux/node
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @flux/node
```

```bash pip
pip install flux-python
```

```bash go
go get github.com/flux-events/flux-go
```
</CodeGroup>

## 2. Initialize the Client

Create a new Flux client with your API key:

```typescript
import Flux from '@flux/node';

const flux = new Flux(process.env.FLUX_API_KEY);
```

<Warning>
  Never hardcode your API key. Use environment variables to keep it secure.
</Warning>

## 3. Send an Event

Events in Flux have a `type` and a `data` payload. The type is a string that identifies the kind of event (we recommend using dot notation like `user.signup`).

```typescript
const event = await flux.events.send({
  type: 'order.completed',
  data: {
    orderId: 'ord_8x7kj2',
    amount: 9900,
    currency: 'usd',
    customerId: 'cus_abc123'
  }
});

console.log('Event sent:', event.id);
```

## 4. Verify It Worked

Head to the [Events tab](https://app.flux.dev/events) in your dashboard. You should see your event logged with its full payload and metadata.
